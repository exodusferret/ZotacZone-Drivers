## 🎮 Usage: OpenZone Manager

Once installed, you can configure your device settings (RGB, Dials, Mappings) using the manager script.

**To run the manager:**
```bash
sudo ./openzone_manager.sh
```
*(If you are in the directory where it was downloaded. If you moved it to a bin folder, just run the command).*

### Manager Features:
1.  **Back Buttons (M1/M2):** Map them to keys like `Space`, `Enter`, or gamepad buttons like `A`, `B`.
2.  **RGB Control:** Select effects like "Wave" or set a static hex color.
3.  **Dial Config:** Change what the Left/Right dials do (e.g., set Left to Volume and Right to Scroll).
4.  **Deadzones:** Set the inner deadzone percentage (default is usually 0-5%).
5.  **Vibration:** Turn off haptics or lower the intensity.

> **Note:** Changes made in the manager are saved immediately to the system configuration or the controller's onboard memory.

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

If you wish to remove the drivers, services, and configuration files completely, simply run the uninstall script provided in the repository.

* Clean up systemd service files.

    * *Bazzite/Fedora:* `rpm-ostree install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) gcc make`
* **Secure Boot:** If Secure Boot is enabled, you may need to sign the kernel modules manually, or disable Secure Boot.
